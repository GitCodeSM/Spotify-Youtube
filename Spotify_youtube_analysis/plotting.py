1. Likes, comments, and average track duration in ms are almost same for all the top viewed artists on spotify for 10 tracks.
2. XXTENTACION, Dua lipa, Weekend, Khalid and post malone are outliers with less views but with high streams which means
   that they have a fanbase which is smaller than others who watched the video on youtube, especially XXTENTACION,
   but they listen to their songs a lot on spotify.
3. Bruno mars, Coldplay, Justin bieber and Ed sheeran have the least gap between their streams and views
   and XXXTENTACION has the highest gap in the views and streams and has higher streams than all these 4 artists for top 10 tracks.

st.write('''
Conclusion:
1. Post malone and Ed sheeran are most listened artists and Ed sheeran is the most viewed artist for total 10 tracks.
   This isn't a proof of consistency but of total performance.
2. Bruno mars, Coldplay, Justin bieber and Ed sheeran have the least gap in their streams and views and have consistency
   in their top 10 hits on Spotify and Youtube respectively.
