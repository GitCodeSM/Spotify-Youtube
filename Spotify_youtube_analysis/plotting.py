1. XXXTENTACION has least views with very high share of energy and highest danceability,
   but has one of the highest streams equal to Dua lipa. He has second highest loudness,
   but less than billie and has one of the highest speechiness in his tracks.
2. Bille E has lowest streams with lowest valence in her songs, but with highest loudness, significant speechiness, and
   highest accousticness and instrumentalness with significant danceability and energy is one of the top 13 streamed artist.
3. Dua lipa with highest danceabilty, highest energy, average liveness, significant speechiness and average loudness,
   highest valence equal to maroon 5 and greater than bruno, justin and ed sheeran,
   lowest accousticness and no instrumentalness in her tracks, is one of the top 13 streamed artists.
4. Bruno, Maroon 5 and dua lipa have the highest valence in their songs.
5. Imagine dragons have highest liveness and second highest energy.
6. Ariana has highest tempo, good valence and accousticness, significant loudness and one of the highest speechiness,
   very high energy with lowest danceabilty like dua lipa and good liveliness to be in the top 13 most stremes artists.

1. Likes, comments, and average track duration in ms are almost same for all the top 10 streamed artists on spotify for 10 tracks.
2. XXTENTACION, Dua lipa, Weekend, Khalid and post malone are outliers with less views but with high streams which means
   that they have a fanbase which is smaller than others who watched the video on youtube, especially XXTENTACION,
   but they listen to their songs a lot on spotify or their songs are popular but their videos are not consistently popular.
3. Bruno mars, Coldplay, Justin bieber and Ed sheeran have the least gap between their streams and views, but XXXTENTACION has
   the highest gap in the views and streams and has higher streams than all these 4 artists for top 10 tracks.

st.write('''
Final Conclusion:
1. Post malone and Ed sheeran are most listened artists and Ed sheeran is the most viewed artist for total 10 tracks.
2. Bruno mars, Coldplay, Justin bieber and Ed sheeran have the least gap in their streams and views showing consistent
   appreciation for both videos and streams in their top 10 hits on Spotify and Youtube respectively.
3. The views and streams analysed are based on total performance of top 10 tracks, and are not about the consistency.
4. An artist can have extreme success on spotify streams, but very less on their youtube videos."
5. It's important to have good combination of valence, energy and liveness in one's tracks with significant accousticness
   to achieve consistency in views and streams.
6. However, having high energy, high loudness, and high danceability can give you very high streams for certain songs
   compared to other artists like in case of XXXTENTACION, but it can't ensure consistency in high views.
